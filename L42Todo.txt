-CACHING: there is a bug when sometime a .unwrap field is null, causing an assert error. It is about re running after errors.

-L42 optimization: if an e is just the Full.L emptyLibrary, I can avoid a lot of fromming of CTzs.... it can speed up a lot whith tests using{}: as tag!

-Close: the java file call Close.java seams to be the starting point to do more caching


-Upgrade Class: check that the library is consistent (and may extract from a trait)
Class: check that the library is consistent (and may extract from a trait)
Class.Abstract and Data.Abstract may not check consistency?

-Class$CanIncoherent is a terrible name

-capturing stack overflow?


Should I do Alphanumeric?
//   );}@Test public void t1(){top(//TODO: fix, so that also a class expression can be a top level toLibrary?
//   top("{A={class method Library #toLibrary()={#norm{}}} B=(class A a=A<:class A a)}","{A={#typed{}}B={#typed{}}#norm{}}")


//NO?:
Should organize check that $ renamed stuff is renamed onto an existing target?
otherwise Organize:{Foo={}   Fooo$={}} works with no reported errors
But.... Foo$Bar is ok if Foo exists and Bar does not...
