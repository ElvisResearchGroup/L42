 
Assertions are a popular way to keep code execution
under control. Assertions are checked only in the specific
execution point where they are encountered;
In the context of OO programming, it would be
convenient to keep \textbf{objects state
under constant control} by using assertions-like properties, that
can be encoded as a \Q@Bool valid()@ method.
During execution,
an object is \textbf{valid} only if running its
\Q@.valid()@ method would return \Q@true@;
objects without a \Q@.valid()@ method are always \textbf{valid}.
We would like a language semantic where 
execution only manipulates \textbf{valid} objects:
if the object offers a \Q@.valid()@ method, then such
 method is automatically checked at run time in the right moments.
While this is related to class invariants,
there are substantial differences:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Just Self consistency}: there is no expectation for
the behaviour of \Q@.valid()@ to match a formal specification defined outside.
The system only ensures that the expectations of the programmer are consistent.
\item \textbf{Always Hold}: 
In the Class Invariant model, the invariant can be broken in
certain moments. Thus code can manipulate objects with broken invariant.
Here code is guarantee to only manipulate \textbf{valid} objects.
Properties requiring more flexibility can be manually supported by
 using certain programming pattern over the primitive validity concept (see ...).
\item \textbf{Alternative language design}:
We do not aim to verify programs that are correct under a conventional language,
thus certain common (and arguably correct) patterns are disallowed.
We define a new language where it is easier to make a program correct by construction, relying on
strict programming patterns.
\end{itemize}

\noindent To understand the main challenges
toward our goal,
consider the following code 
simulating a commercial port
 where a boat is being loaded with cargo:
\saveSpace
\begin{lstlisting}
class Boat{$\Comment{too much cargo and the ship may sink}$
  Bool valid(){  return cargo.weight()<=300;}
  Items cargo;
  Void load(Item item){  this.cargo.add(item);}
  Item unload(String itemName){  return this.cargo.extract(itemName);}
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\saveSpace




\Q@Item@ and \Q@Items@ come from a third party library,  are not annotated with contracts and the authors may change their behaviour in the future.
All the code using \Q@Boat@  (client code) would like to 
assume the boat has not sunk.
In turn, that depends on the behaviour of \Q@Items.weight()@, thus the meaning of the \Q@Boat@ invariant is parametric on the everchanging meaning of  \Q@Items.weight()@.
In this sense, we are only interested in \emph{self-consistency}.
Can we somehow enforce that for every possible well typed \Q@Item@ and \Q@Items@, client code will interact only with valid (non sunk)  boats?
That is, we are unable or unwilling to constrain \Q@Item@ and \Q@Items@ to
cooperate into making \Q@Boat@s unsinkable; we aim
to make so that \Q@Boat@s can be correct independently of
possibly buggy, possibly even malicious \Q@Item@ and \Q@Items@ implementations.

%Thanks to the encapsulation, any kind of check in the language,
%as in `\Q@if(cargo.weight()>=300){..}@', would delegate the 
%behaviour to untrusted code in \Q@Items@.
Since the code of \Q@Items@ is completely unrestrained, 
even if at a certain moment, a boat respects its
invariant, there is no guarantee that
it will hold at another moment,
even if methods \Q@load/unload@ are not called.
Aliasing would be the most obvious cause, but also I/O can be to blame.
Worse, the \Q@cargo@ may internally record how many times
it has been used, providing low weight whenever we try to test its behaviour, and a high one otherwise.


In this paper we will formally define  \textbf{Validation}, an \textbf{ultra-lightweight runtime verification technique} 
 keeping object state under control, and 
 a Java-like imperative language
 with conventional field update and exceptions handling
 but where the type system and the input/output functionalities
 have been tweaked just enough to support Validation.
 To this aim we will leverage on recent developments in the area of object capabilities,
 aliasing and immutability control, and strong exception safety.
%Our approach share the same philosophy of checked casts:


%That is: the type system is just powerful enough,
%and semantics is just constrained enough,
% so that, independently of the rest of the program,
% we can assume the \Q@Boat@ validity
% while working with \Q@Boat@ instances,
%and being promptly notified of sinking \Q@Boat@s;




\noindent\textit{Paper structure:}
First we show an informal definition of \emph{sound invariant checking}, and we compare it with 
the meaning of invariants in other approaches.
Then in Section~\ref{s:example} by way of a general example we show how arduous our goal is.
Unsurprisingly aliasing is an issue, but so are subtyping, encapsulation, exceptions, and undesired side effects like mutation and I/O.
As we will explain in Section~\ref{s:related}, state of the art runtime verification systems
ignore at least some of the challenges highlighted by our example,
making them unsound from the perspective of our definition of Validation.

% TODO (alex): The above needs cites and unsound needs explanation!


In Section~\ref{s:language} we discuss our approach in the context of
a nominally and statically typed object-oriented language with
imperative features such as field update, input/output and exceptions.
It can perform I/O using  \textbf{object capabilities}.
It supports a rich type system offering \textbf{aliasing and immutability control} and \textbf{strong exception safety}.
We show how to ensure our property for various categories of objects, and 
how those features are important building blocks to support our approach.

Finally in Section~\ref{s:meaning} we formally define \emph{sound invariant checking} and
a language supporting it by a rich type system.
 Section~\ref{s:related} discusses the related work and Section~\ref{s:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Defining Validation}
\label{s:def}
\saveSpace
The programmer may specifies their desired validation by adding an \Q@.valid()@ method:
Each class that has an \Q@.valid()@ method is a
\emph{validate class}.
Such \Q@valid@ methods must return a boolean and take no parameter.
It should reason only over the reachable object graph (ROG) of \Q@this@, and
it must be \textbf{deterministic}:
it should not mutate any pre-existing objects and it should not interact with the outside world.%
\footnote{The \Q@valid()@ method could throw exceptions, as discussed later.}

Thus, it cannot access any external input or mutable global state.
These requirements allow such method to be seen as a logic predicate over the object.

An object is \textit{valid} if its \Q@.valid()@ method
would deterministically reduce to \Q@true@ in a finite numbers of steps.
An object is \textit{invalid} in case of \Q@.valid()@ returning \Q@false@,
non termination and any kind of exception/dynamic error.

We say that a language soundly preserve \textbf{Validation} if
application code can never handle an invalid object.
This is obtained by a specialized language semantic invoking the \Q@.valid()@
method when an object may be invalid; however such invocations are not present in
the application code: the code manually wrote by the programmer.

%In order for the formal semantic of the language to call the \Q@.valid()@ method
%and for such method to access the state of
%It is possible to define Validation over a conventional small step reduction semantic.
%There are only two cases where reduction steps may involve invalid objects:
%(1) when a \Q@.valid()@ method is called the receiver may be invalid, and (2) inside of the \Q@.valid()@ method, a possibly
%invalid \Q@this@ may be used to read the value of the fields.
%We call these reduction steps \emph{trusted}.
%Note that we are referring to the individual reduction steps when calling \Q@.valid()@,
%and accessing fields. We do not need to relax the whole computation of the \Q@.valid()@ method.

% TODO (alex) Huh? Relax the whole computation of the method? What does this even mean?

\noindent This means that, for example, at the point of a method call,
all the parameters (including \Q@this@) will soundly respect their invariant.
%\footnote{
%Our presented solution in Section~\ref{s:meaning} does not requires to run the invariant method
%for all the objects in every reduction step, and should induce an acceptable overhead. We will consider efficiency later in the paper.}

\noindent At first glance, it may seem that Verification ensures the absence of invalid objects.
Note our careful wording earlier: we are not stating that all objects are valid all the time.
A Verification system can just use exceptions to
steer the execution before the invalid objects have an opportunity to be handled.
If you were to step with the debugger, you may see invalid objects, and
validation checks failing.

%Our very strong Validation property allows to reason about any program in a reliable way.
%On the other side, it limits the freedom of programmers,
%unable to break SIC even if they needs to and they believe it would be `safe'.
%We think this can be compared with type systems, where sometime we
%need to introduce extra indirections to satisfy the type system.

 


%Some have attempted using AOP 
% change the semantic of the language injecting checks and collecting data across the whole system.
 
%In this paper we go in the opposite direction and we consider what expressive type

\section{Breaking Things}
\label{s:example}
\saveSpace

\subsection{Breaking objects}
\saveSpace

Some readers may suggest we should detect violations just before operations that would create an invalid object,
thus still keeping all objects always valid.

Sadly, this seems impossible in the general case with limited knowledge.
%, and even if we could detect them it
%would have nasty consequences.
Going back to our \Q@Boat@ example,
\textbf{without any knowledge about the behaviour of \Q@add()@ and \Q@weight()@}%
%\footnote{A statically verified system with contracts on all methods may have this kind of knowledge.}
there is no way we can discover the invariant violation without actually adding the objects and checking the 
weight after the fact; thus in the general case violations can only be detected 
when an invalid object is already present in the system.
Remember that to keep our approach lightweight,
we do not rely on pre-post conditions; thus
the behaviour of \Q@Items.weight()@ and \Q@Items.add(item)@ is uncertain.
The names may suggest a specific behaviour, but there is no contract annotated on such methods.

Note also that in the general case there is no way to fix an invalid object,
or to perform a deep clone and to test the operation on the clone first.
In environments offering a powerful enough aspect-oriented support,
it could be possible to detect any field update in the whole ROG of
any object, following the strategy of 
Gopinathan et al.~\cite{Gopinathan:2008:RMO:1483018.1483028}.
Using such power would even be possible to roll-back the very field update that caused 
the invariant to fail, making the object valid again.
However, we think this would be a \textbf{terrible idea causing unexpected strange behaviour}: for example
assume that we are moving object between two boats:
the overflowing object may be removed from the \Q@cargo@ of the second boat, but it would not
be placed back in the first boat. It would look like the object has disappeared.
The important point here is that the program would be in an unexpected state
even if no object are invalid, and this would happen \textbf{because} of the 
checking/fixing behaviour, not because of code written by the programmer.

We believe that the only viable option is to detect violations 
\textbf{after the fact}, that is,
after an invalid object has been materialised.


We detect existing invalid objects by encoding Validation as a normal instance method.
Using the underlying programming language instead of a dedicated specification language allows one to transparently refer to the behaviour/interface of any of these reachable objects without exposing their internal representation.
Indeed, in the general case, without relying on primitive types and with no assumptions on the meaning of methods,
\textbf{using the underlying language is the only way to express Validation.}
