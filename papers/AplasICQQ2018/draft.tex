\begin{abstract}
Quasi Quotation~\cite{moggi1999idealized,pitman1980special,sheard2002template} is a very expressive metaprogramming technique: it allows expressing arbitrary behaviour by
generating arbitrary abstract syntax trees.
However it is hard to reason about Quasi Quotation statically,
the process is fundamentally low-level, imperative and bug prone.
In this paper we present Iterative Composition as
an \textbf{effective alternative} to Quasi Quotation.
Iterative Composition describes a code composition algebra over established code reuse techniques,
similar to trait composition and generics.
Our main contribution is that by applying functional reasoning (such as induction and folds)
over those well-known operators we can generate arbitrary behaviour.
This allows us to reuse the extensive body of verification research in the 
context of object-oriented languages to verify the properties
of the code generated by Iterative Composition.
Finally, we present a prototype implementation of Iterative Composition in the context of the 42 language.


%Today the most common forms of metaprogramming 
%use quasi quotation to generated arbitrarily shaped ASTs.
%This approach ensures absolute power, but is also 
%very difficult to use this power correctly.
%We believe this is an intrinsically ``imperative'' approach,
%and as such is frail and bug-prone.
%
%In the past many code reuse techniques, like 
%subclassing and generics was also considered Metaprogramming.
%We show in this paper how code reuse primitives can generate arbitrary behaviour.
%
%This radically different approach can be safer and simpler, since using
%it requires combining declarative operations using abstraction typical
%of functional reasoning (induction and folds)
