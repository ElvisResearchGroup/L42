# L42
-------------------------------
# Importing in eclipse:
Do (file->)import ->git-> projects(from git)->clone uri

If asked, import Eclipse projects (instead of NewProject or GeneralProject)
You should get the project already  setted up with the right dependencies.
Note:
* If you do not change Main/L42.g4 you do not need to run AntlrGeneration
* If you do not change Main/srcLombock you do not need to run DelombockAst
* On need you can launch them by simply right clicking on the corresponding .lauch file
