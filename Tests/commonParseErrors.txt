Writing a class body and leaving out a method keyword
- causes a parse failure near the close-parenthesis on the method name
- often with requests for colons, possibly because the parser expects the path to extend further

Confusion between curly brackets for class literals and expressions
- a perfect parser should search for the keyword 'return'
- the current parser is probably searching for 'method' keywords

-C:{  } declares a nested class, but many ends up writing C{ }, this cause weird parser errors.

also, for parameter passing: should be "name:expr" but is very easy to write "name expr" or "name=expr"
