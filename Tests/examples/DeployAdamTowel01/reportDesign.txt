Misuse 'It is a shorter name for Precondition Violation
  UnsupportedOperation: if "this" is unfit
  MetaprogrammingGuard: for composition operators
as exceptions, Misuse objects are a way to report/guard complex operations,
 where checking the shape of the input can be unconvenient.
as errors, they represent precondition violations. 
Turning an exception Misuse into an error Misuse
 is equivalent of declaring that such misuse should not happen (responsability of the caller)

ObservedBug: 'except in rare case, should be only used as errors.
'if this happens, then the programmer had wrong assumption on the code behaviour.
  CodeNotReachable: code not reachable can wrap a Report (often a Misuse) to declare that such Report should
    happen (responsabilty on the code logic)

Report vs not Report:
Reports have many fields and "explanations", others have only stringable
