Redirect:
  redirect starts from start, dest, call redirectOk (defined under)
  remove the set of internal paths
  redirect the internal path usage on the external ones.

------------------------------------
  A= ambiguities, Set of (int Path, (set ext Path)) functional
  V= verified redirects Set of (int Path, ext Path) functional
    so that for all v of them redirectOk(p,v,L,A,Exc) is well defined for some R,A,Exc
 Exc=Set of ( (Set of Path ), (Set of extPath))
------------------------------------
starting from r1, A={r1}, V=empty, Exc=empty

  take an element r from (unambiguous(A) less V),
    if redirectOk(p,r,L,A,Exc), then
    	V += r, //this can throw amibuity error
    	A += V //this can throw ambiguty error //plus equal do the intersection of codomains
    	  //for example  V= a->c,  A=a-> b,c  A+V=a->c
    	  //for example  V= a->d,  A=a-> b,c  A+V= is ambibuguos since d not intersect b,c
    	A -= V //this remove all the dom(V) from dom(A), is safe since A+=V worked before

  When unambiguous(A) is empty,
    check that all ps->ps' in Exc, where V(ps) superset of ps'
    check that A is empty

return V

     A += ps->ps'//if intPath in A already mapped in A, do the intersection of the ambiguities. Error if the empty set is produced.


redirectOkT(p, T,T,A,Exc)  is ok //same exact T, method clash if the two T are external but different.
redirectOkT(p,.. intPath .. ,..extPath..,A,Exc)  A+=intPaht->extPath//two T different only for the path.
