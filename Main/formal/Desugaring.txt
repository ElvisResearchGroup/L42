We need to:
-Design sugared 42 grammar
-sugared well formedness
-desugaring process

Here we put ideas for better desugaring:

-use the new pattern in with for closing the iterators with rethrowable errors

-possible new pattern for While:
while e block
becomes:
( var T v = e //how we get that type? Why it can not be a skeletal?
  //we can instead of duplicating the e,
  // use guess type to obtain the P, then call P.#false() 
  //and initialize v for real at the start of the loop instead of the end
  loop (
    v.checkIfTrue()
    block
    v := e
    )
  catch exception Void v1 if v (exception void)
  void/*unreachable*/
  )
  
 This avoid the concepts of break.
 OR, on the opposite:
 if the bool class has a #falseType() and #checkTrue() throw a falseType...
the sugar could do
 catch exception guessType(x)::#falseType()
 and the user could break by doing exception Break()
