0 Objectives
-----------------------------

Challenges:
Generated Java should be 
-incremental
-fast to compile
-fast to execute//the less important now
-executable in parallel
-the generated class files should be cachable on remote server
-have a decent definition for correct plug in behaviour/checking in case, for example, of the
 redirect, where the class Any could be norm but not well typable yet

key ideas:
-every L has a unique generated name added during normalization
-plugin application will generate new names for resulting libraries //james suggests: old names may be marked as orphans
-every 42 execution generate a Resource class that have
  -current program // current program do not appear in map, current.top() always not LC
  -map from generate names to program view in that point//programs in map,p.top() always LC
   (no need to be the most updated program view?)
 Thus, multiple 42 executions can run in parallel, but 
 multiple C:e in an execution needs to be sequential.
 
 
Starting point:
  L42N: L42 core, compiled, well typed and normalized, with some types annotated.

Intermediate; only for expressions in meth bodies:
  L42X: L42N with all subexpressions are xs, and L are replaced with their unique name CN

Destinaton1:
  L42F: a flattened version where every *executable*
  class/interface have a top level name 
  this language also contains null, if, bool and so on..
   -design a process to optimize L42F using those features.
    Should be so that
    optimize(optimize(program))=optimize(program)

Destination 2:
  Java, C++, Javascript,..
  -design process to convert L42F programs into stuff.

-----------------------------
1 Grammar
-----------------------------

L42N //should be identical to the one in NotationsAndGrammar

e::=x|void|P|L|throw[T1,T2] e|loop e|(ds ks e[T])| e.m[P]((x:e)s)| use P check m((x:e)s) e
throw::= exception | error | return
k::=catch throw T x e
d::= T x=e

L42F 
CT::= CN->p,CD,Javabytecode
CD::=kind CN implements CNs{ Mxs }
Mx::=refine? method T mxs((T x)s) body?//first is this
//note: no exceptions declared, body empty only if kind=interface
body::=ex | setter|getter|new|newWithFwd|newFwd nativeIntSum|nativeIntMul|...|nativeVectorAdd
kind::=class |interface | nativeInt |nativeString| nativeFloat|nativeVector[CN] | ...
miniE::=x|void|CN|null| throw[TX1,TX2] x |loop ex
  |CN.mxs(ys)| use CN check mxs(ys) ex
  |if x then ex1 else ex2 |while ???x?_or_?ex?? then ex1 | x1:=x2 |(mdf CN)x
ex::=miniE | (dxs kxs ex [TX])
kx::=catch throw TX x ex
dx::=TX x=ex
TX::=mdf CN

----
note: method calling/method dispatch in L42F:
methods with refine or with no body are dynamically dispatched 
and must have a 'this' parameter (other still can have a 'this' parameter)
others are statically dispatched.
CN is just an instance of class/interface CN.
Some native bodies would fail if the 'this' parameter is the CN instance.
The translation L42N to L42F will work in the following way:
-class methods declared in classes behave like static method with no 'this'
-non class methods declared in classes behave line static method with first 'this' parameter
-class methods declared in interfaces, with dynamic dispatch
  behave like python class methods with first 'this class' parameter
-non class methods declared in interfaces, with dynamic dispatch
  behave like java method with first 'this' parameter

In addition, L42F can support implemented interface methods with no 'this' parameter (we use them for some predefined behavior)
  they behave java interface static methods

We assume the presence of some Prefefined classes/methods in L42F:
  Void, Any and Library, all offering only 
  method CN NewFwd() newFwd //also Any have it!//yes, statically binded

We also assume a class
nativeResource Resource{
  
  method Library LoadLib(class Any that)nativeLoadLib
  //return the Library denoted by the provided CN
  
  method Void Fix(Any a,Any b)nativeFix //hoping a is a Fwd
  //replace a with b in all the places a was stored.
  //every newFwd edits a list inside of Fwds to remember where they are stored.
  }

-----------------------------
2 L42N into L42F
-----------------------------
//for compactness ignore use, treated the same as mcall
//also, assume all local variables alpharenamed to be different
//and all newly introduced variables are fresh

4 General execution
-----------------------------
Execution

CT.execute(p,e)=CT.loadAndRun(J)
  ex=p;empty[e]
  sJ=toJava(ex)
  J=class CN{ public static Object execute(){sJ}}//CN fresh

CT.loadAndRun(CN,J)
  CT contains/related to a class loader that access CT to load classes
  CT.loader.load(toBytecode(J))
  return CT.loader.usualReflectionToCall("CN.execute()")

-------------
We need to save in CT also the compiled bytecode;
we need to make CT serializable and save it with "names" related to the "stage"
of the program, for example the compilation of all a towel.
should we use a db instead of files?
example caching system:
when L42 run in a folder, near This.L42 we create a _This.db
that contains the following info:
-how many compilation iterations last time,
-for each iteration:
  -the p, the e, the used paths, the used CT, the resulting r
when re-compiling, if the same iteraion uses the same e, the same used paths as
cached, and for each P in paths, p(P) is the same, then we can re use the cached CT and re run e.
If the resulting r is different, we trash all cache for following iterations. 
Discuss advantages/disadvantages

how to implement attempt:
  loader using CT/CT can be updated/swapped (this will not influence already loaded classes)

start:
  //??desugaring will also import pre compiled used towels.
  CT=beginning ct
  loader=loaderOf(CT)
  normalization(loader)
  
loader;paths|- eC -->p+ r   
  loader.CT=loader.CT.growWith(p,paths)
  r=loader.CT.execute(p,eC)

CTJ is just [JBC1..JBCn]
loader.CTJ.growWith(JBC1..JBCn)//no repetition with the ones already loaded
loader.CTJ.execute(JBC)

test
CTJ=empty
CTJ.growWith(stuff)
execute stuff
save to disc
load
grow more stuff
execute more stuff




-----------------------------
5 Optimization//later?
-----------------------------
Goals:
-bool/int/float etc should be types directly used in the code and
their operations should be directly used.
-Strings/other well known plugin imported data should be directly used too.
-if and while should be handled without exceptions
-Opt should be implemented with normal (optionally null) pointers
-lists (also of mutable objects) should use a primitive vector/arraylist concept
-classes with a single fields should be "erased" most of the times
-method inlining should happen often
-type cases/casts should be simplified away when possible (may be thanks to inlining?)
-optimization of number/string literal

optimization of number/string literal:
during de sugaring make them separete functions, then all class method imm Foo are cached the first time they are executed
(since 42 is compiled on the way, it is as fast as executing them at compile time, and for
precompiled libraries we can have an operator forcing it)
-------
Note: optimizing a local variable seams harder then adding them to the core...
In case we want to add local var to core, need to happen after /at the same time
of implementing L42IntoJava.


Main idea: a sequence of iteration over
CT-->CT[CN=nativeOfThatPattern(CT(CN))]
if CT(CN)= aSpecificPattern
something like this should work for int,float,arrays and a couple more stuff
for Opts would work in combination with wrapper class optimization

Example int:
for some x, CN, m, P, plus,times
int32Pattern=
class CN{
  method Library x() getter
  method CN New_m(x)(Library x) new
  method CN plus(CN this,CN that) 
    CN.New_m(use P 
    check int32_sum(left:this.x(), right: that.x())
    error _)
  method CN times(CN that) ...
  }//note, not all methods need to be there
int32Native=
int32Native CN{//here instead we will generate all methods
  method Library x() int32NativeToLib
  method CN New_m(Library x) int32NativeFromLib
  method CN plus(CN this,CN that)int32NativeSum
  method CN times(CN this,CN that)int32NativeMul
  }
  //discuss: can we have two plus methods? can we have extra methods and just leave them be?

WrapperClasses:
class is wrapper if
- exactly one field,
- no implements
- never casted to Any??//can not be checked on an open program
//TS may annotate T->Any(e), then that can be replace with new T? chain of news up to surviving inner type?
//no need of the chain, wrapper classes are fixed one at the time?
- either no setter(opt has no setter)
  or never used in constructors and setters//may not need //also can not be checked on an open program 
  
  then
  replace all CN with the field type except for CN.mxs
  CN constructors are simplified away
  CN.f(x,z) setters are x:=z
  CN.f(x) getter are y=x 
  all throw where mdf CN x, use new
  all catch throw mdf CN x, unwrap if not just rethrow
  //check this does not break {..return..} optimization
  
  //note for marco: I believe/ed that this means redirect need to refuse to work on private P
  //note for marco: if we rename all private nested classes to the top level, we can avoid most privacy coupuled; it would only stay for private methods.

If/While insertion:
If insertion:
(T y=CN.#checkTrue(x)  catch exception Void ex1 ex2)
  replaced with
if x ex2 else ex1
  if CT(CN).kind=nativeInt //just to avoid native bools too?


Throw/cast simplification
(throw[T,_] ax
 catch throw T x x
 _)
   replaced with 
   ax

Throw/cast simplification
(throw[T0,_] ax
 catch throw T1 x x
 ..
 catch throw Tn x x
 e)
????? need casts ? ifs? type switch?
