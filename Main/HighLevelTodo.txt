-RedirectOk needs to follow another plan:
  A= ambiguities, Set of (int Path-> (set ext Path)) functional
  V= verified redirects Set of int Path->ext Path functional
    so that for all v of them redirectOk(p,v, cb,R,A,Exc)  is well defined for some R,A,Exc
 Exc=Set of ( (Set of Path )-> (Set of extPath))
    then, starting from r1,  A={R1}, V=empty, Exc=empty
  take an element r from (unambiguos(A) less V),    
    if redirectOk(p,r,cb,A,Exc), then 
    V+=r, //this can throw amibuity error
    A+=V //this can throw ambiguty error //plus equal do the intersection of codomains
    A-=V //this remove all the dom(V) from dom(A), is safe since A+=V worked before
  When unambiguos(A)  is empty,  
    check that for all ps->ps' in Exc, V(ps) superset of ps'
    check that A is empty
   and return V
   
   define redirectOk(p,intPath->extPath,cb,R;A;Exc)
   intCb=cb(intPath)
   extCb=p,cb(extPath)
   if there is any implementation in intCb is an error src unfit
   if there is any private in intCb is error src unfit
   with ps, ps' is implemented interfaces of intCb,extCb
      ps=intPs,extPs
      extPs subset of ps' or srcUnfitError?
      A+=intPs[from intPath]->ps'[from extPath] U Any//if intPath in A already mapped in A, do the intersection of the ambiguities. Error if the empty set is produced.
      //should give ambiguity error is interface in one set is empty on h other? redirect to Any?
   for all the nested c of intCb,
      A+= intPaht::c->extPath::c
   for all the mwt in intCb, check that there is a corresponding mwt' in extCb,
   if not error srcUnfit unextped member
   then redirectOkMwt(p,mwt[from intPath],mwt'.withNoBody()[from extPath],A,Exc)
   
   redirectOkMwt(p, T0 (T1..Tn) ps,T0' (T1'..Tn')ps',A,Exc)
     redirectOkT(p,Ti,T'i,A,Exc)
     Exc+=ps->ps'
     A+=ps->ps'//if intPath in A already mapped in A, do the intersection of the ambiguities. Error if the empty set is produced.
     
  
  redirectOkT(p, T,T,A,Exc)  is ok //same exact T, method clash if the two T are external but different.
  redirectOkT(p,.. intPath .. ,..extPath..,A,Exc)  A+=intPaht->extPath//two T different only for the path.
  
  -when this is ok, we need to reorganize the errors, we need to add the ambigus redirect.
  
   Other tasks
   
    -private rename normalization
    collect privates: 
     MethodLocator:{List<Member> mTail; List<Integer> mPos; Ms that, Ms newName}
     NestedLocator:{List<Member> mTail; List<Integer> mPos; String that, String newName}
     collectPrivates(cb)->set of MethodLocator,NestedLocator
     since no sum will be triggered, we can do all the rename together
     collectPrivates(cb) first collect the names, then compute the rename, keeping in account private state consistency
       that is, constructors get the same pedex appended to name AND fields, and field get the same pedex
     renamePrivates(collectPrivates(cb))
       clone with path:
         on nested, if collected rename
         on mwt if collected rename
         on mi nothing, never private
         on path, if collected rename, will need to explore only a "pure nested" part of the tail
         on meth call, same idea. Reuse guess receiver type from rename method.
    reuse of lower case, trust private normalized and desugared.
       replace all the name__N_0 in name__N'_redirectIndex
    normalizePrivates(newIndex) rename all the name__N_K in name__N'_index
    reuse on Uppercase, do desugar and do not do private renaming at all.// just for testing
         
    -enhance classB/program so that they can be annotated for:
    -is private normalized
    -get the set of used families
    -if ct is needed, here is all the annotations
    -program/extract type start working only when annotation is required in actual type system but not available
      like p.requireStage(path)? p.requireAllMethodSignatures(path)? 
       
    -db plugin
      design of resources: make connection string "is" resource handler?
    -put Outer without number in the sugar
    - put << normalization in the sugar
    -put keywords/behaviour for circular and entangled. 
    -put outer keyword, to skip the first in scope
    -put partial, mut partial and so on instead of ^ in parser
    -run coverage (emma eclipse tool?)
    -remove @consistent?
    -use @as default? instead of #?
     so Map[
       @[a;b;c];
       @[a;b;c];
       ]
    options[isVisible:@]   vs  options[isVisible:Bool.true()]
    Car(weels:@[....] doors:@[])
    RenamePath[@"Bar" to:@"Beer"]
    -operators <-  ->   \/ /\ ?? may be not?
    -usually ~ is give me internal, so rename all .binary repr?
    -make opt have checktrue, ! & and | ?
    -for collections, error S" still report stuff that should be done better.

-for concatenating strings, use S[a;b;c] where a,b,c should be ToS,
and ++ should take only strings in input.

-rethink typeextraction. use caching of info somehow.
-if runaway abstractness/incoherence causes plus, plus should keep
track of why it exists.


**current problems:
rename private methods need to rename also private methods in library literals,
those mcalls can be in interface implemented methods.
to get the types, I need the program? but I do not want to use clone with program.
if in addition to member and index I was to have current classB,
locators would be sort of like programs
also, I could use null for classB and avoid negative indexes
class caching:
one objects? many objects?

method implemented keep type
CachedMT{ OptMt, OptPath }
CachedStage:{Stage, map of dependencies path->classB, verified bool}

extractMt(ms,classB,locator,program)
extractStage(classB,locator,program)
Now:
  remove extractCt stuff,
  add the two extract over.
  Then, remove cts form the program. 



-TargetUnavable become MemberUnavable

-well formedness, state must be all private or all public.
This is also connected with removing @consistent from desugaring
