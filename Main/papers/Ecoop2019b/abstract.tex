\begin{abstract}
There are various interpretations as to when class invariants should hold and how they should be checked.
We present a sound invariant protocol, where invariants hold for all objects involved in execution.
We soundly support mutation, dynamic dispatch, exceptions and non determinism, while requiring only a modest number of runtime checks and annotations.
Invariants are specified as methods whose execution is statically guaranteed to be deterministic and \IODel{to} not 
access any externally mutable state.
This design restricts the range of expressible invariants but improves upon the usability and performance of our system compared to prior work.

We present a case study showing that our protocol requires a lower annotation burden compared to Spec\#, and  performs orders of magnitude less runtime invariant checks compared to the widely used `visible state semantics' protocols of D, Eiffel, and other languages. \IOComm{mention the family?}
We statically control aliasing, mutability, and determinism using
a flavour of type modifiers and object capabilities already present in three different experimental languages.
We also formalise our invariant protocol and prove \IO{that such} type modifiers and object capabilities are sufficient to ensure \IO{the soundness of our protocol}.
