Object-oriented programming languages through sub-typing and dynamic dispatch provide great flexibility: they
allow code to be adapted/specialised to behave differently in different contexts.
%%, which is made even more complex by dynamic class loading (supported by many mainstream OO languages).
However this flexibility hampers code reasoning since object behaviour is usually nearly completely
unrestricted. This is further complicated with the support OO languages typically have for exceptions,
memory mutation, and I/O.
% Class invariants are a well known technique to help write correct code, however there are various different interpretations of when they should hold.
% invariant protocols, specifying when the invariant is expected to hold and when is checked. 
%% In the absence of on the fly static verification of dynamically loaded code, it is difficult for programmers to write code that is correct in a library setting.


Class-invariants are an important concept when reasoning about software correctness.
They can be presented as documentation, checked as part of static verification, or, as we do in this paper, monitored for violations using runtime-verification.
In our system, a class specifies its invariant by defining a boolean method called \Q@invariant@. We say that an object is \REV{\emph{valid}}{3}{If this term really is necessary (I'm not sure it is), then perhaps it should be used more regularly.} if calling \Q@invariant@ would return \Q@true@.

An \emph{invariant protocol}~\cite{FlexibleInvariants} specifies when invariants need to be checked, and when they can be assumed; if such checks guarantee said assumptions, the protocol is sound.
The two main sound invariant protocols present in literature are \emph{visible state semantic} \cite{Meyer:1988:OSC:534929} and the \emph{Boogie/Pack-Unpack methodology} ~\cite{DBLP:journals/jot/BarnettDFLS04}. Visible state semantics expect receivers invariants to hold before and after every public method call, and after constructors. Invariants are simply checked at all such points, and so this approach is obviously sound; however this can be incredibly inefficient, even in simple cases.
In contrast, the pack-unpack methodology marks all objects as either \emph{packed} or \emph{unpacked}, where a packed object is one whose invariant is expected to hold.
In this approach, an object's invariant is checked only by the pack-operation.
\REV{In order for this to be sound, some form of aliasing and mutation control is necessary.}{1}{If aliasing can be controlled, is there a need to control mutation as well?} For example, Spec\#, which follows the pack-unpack methodology, uses a theorem prover, together with source-code annotations.
While Spec\# can be used for full static verification, it conveniently allows invariant checks to be performed
at run time, while statically verifying aliasing, purity and other similar standard properties.
This allows us to closely compare our approach with Spec\#.

\REV{Instead of using static analysis}{1}{A type system can be a static analysis too}, 
it is becoming more popular to verify aliasing and immutability using a type system.
For example, there are 3 languages: L42~\cite{ServettoZucca15,ServettoEtAl13a,JOT:issue_2011_01/article1,GianniniEtAl16}, Pony~\cite{clebsch2015deny,clebsch2017orca}, and the language of Gordon et. al.\cite{GordonEtAl12} that use Type Modifiers (TMs) and Object Capabilities (OCs) to ensure safe and deterministic parallelism.%
\footnote{TMs are called \emph{reference capabilities} in other works. We use the term TM here
to not confuse them with object capabilities, another technique we also use in this paper.}
While studying those languages, we discovered an elegant way to enforce invariants.


\REV{\textit{Example:}}{3}{I think it would be better to show the full code listing, because later it will be compared to Spec\#.} we now show a simple example, where we have a \Q@Cage@ class with a list of \Q@Point@s \Q@path@ and \Q@Hamster@ with a \Q@Point@ \Q@pos@; the \Q@Cage@ moves the \Q@Hamster@ across its path. \Q@Cage@ has an invariant: the \Q@Hamster@'s location is within the \Q@Cage@'s path.

% While Spec\# requires specialised \Q@Point@, \Q@Hamster@, and \Q@Cage@ declarations to be able to enforce the invariant, our version manages to capture the required information in just a few annotations on \Q@Cage@ and leaves \Q@Point@ and \Q@Hamster@ unmodified.

%	if(that==null || !(that instanceof Point)){return false;}
% 	return ((Point)that).x==this.x && ((Point)that).y==this.y; 
%  }
\begin{lstlisting}
class Point { Double x; Double y; Point(Double x, Double y) {..}
  @Override read method Bool equals(read Object that) {..} 
}
class Hamster {Point pos; //pos is imm by default
  Hamster(Point pos) {..} 
}
class Cage {
  capsule Hamster h;
  List<Point> path;//path is imm by default
  Cage(capsule Hamster h, List<Point> path) {..}
  read method Bool invariant() {
    return this.path.contains(this.h.pos); }
  mut method Void move() {
    Integer index= 1 + this.path.indexOf(this.h.pos));
    this.moveTo(this.path.get(index %$\,$  this.path.size())); }
  mut method Void moveTo(Point p) { this.h.pos = p; } }
\end{lstlisting}
\REV{\REV{Many verification approaches take advantage of the separation between primitive value types and objects.}{1}{It is not clear what is the reason to distinguish between primitive and reference types.}}{3}{What does this mean? Cite something?}
However, our approach works in a pure OO setting distinction. Hence we write all type names in \REV{upper case}{2}{bold}, to underline this. Note: to save space, here and in the rest of the paper we omit the bodies of constructors that simply initialise fields with the values of constructor parameters.

We use the \Q@read@ annotation on \Q@equals@ to express that it does not modify either the
receiver or the parameter. In \Q@Cage@ we use 
\REV{\Q@capsule@}{2}{???} to ensure
that the \Q@Hamster@'s \emph{reachable object graph} (ROG) is fully under the control
of the containing \Q@Cage@. 
We annotated the \Q@move@
and \Q@moveTo@ methods with \Q@mut@, since they modify
their receivers ROG. \REV{Our default annotation is \Q@imm@, thus \Q@Cage@'s \Q@path@ field is a deeply immutable list of \Q@Point@s.}{1}{Does the same apply to the parameter p? A comprehensive list of default annotations should be provided, without deferring to formalism.}
% Note how we just use \Q@List.contains()@ and \Q@List.indexOf()@
% to check if the hamster position is inside the list.
% The conventional syntax correctly instantiates a \Q@Cage@:
% \Q@new Cage(new Hamster(new Point(..)), List.of(new Point(...))@.
Our system performs run-time checks for the invariant
at the end of \Q@Cage@'s constructor, \Q@moveTo@ method, and after any update to one of its fields.
The \Q@moveTo@ method is the only place in the above code where the invariant may be broken. However, there is only a single occurrence of \Q@this@ and it is used to read the \Q@h@ field. We \REV{leverage over}{3}{???} TMs to ensure that no alias to \Q@this@ could be reachable from either \Q@h@ or the immutable \Q@Point@ parameter. Thus, the potentially broken \Q@this@ object is not visible while the \Q@Hamster@'s position is updated. 
The invariant is checked at the end of the \Q@moveTo@ method, just before \Q@this@ would become visible again.
This technique loosely corresponds to an implicit pack and unpack: we use \Q@this@ only to read the field value, then we work on its value while the invariant of \Q@this@ is not known to hold; finally we check the invariant before allowing the object to  be used again.

Note: since only \Q@Cage@ has an invariant,
 only \Q@Cage@ has special restrictions, allowing the code for \Q@Point@ and \Q@Hamster@ to be unremarkable.
 This is not the case in Spec\#: all code involved in  verification needs to be designed with verification in mind~\cite{barnett2011specification}.
% The best solution we found was to define our own equality for \Q@Point@ instead of relying on \Q@Object.Equals@,
% thus we could not use \Q@List.Contains@ and \Q@List.IndexOf@.

\textit{Spec\# example:} Here we show the previous example in Spec\# the system most similar to ours (see appendix \ref{s:justice} for a more detailed discussion about this solution):
%or \small or \footnotesize etc.
\begin{lstlisting}[
%basicstyle=\footnotesize,
language={[Sharp]C}, morekeywords={invariant,ensures,requires,expose,exists}]
// Note: assume everything is 'public'
class Point { double x; double y; Point(double x, double y) {..}
  [Pure] bool Equal(double x, double y) {
    return x == this.x && y == this.y; }
}
class Hamster{[Peer] Point pos; Hamster([Captured] Point pos){..}}

class Cage {
  [Rep] Hamster h; [Rep, ElementsRep] List<Point> path;
  Cage([Captured] Hamster h, [Captured] List<Point> path)
    requires Owner.Same(Owner.ElementProxy(path), path); {
      this.h = h; this.path = path; base();}
  invariant exists {int i in (0 : this.path.Count);
    this.path[i].Equal(this.h.pos.x, this.h.pos.y)};
  void Move() {
    int i = 0;
    while(i<path.Count && !path[i].Equal(h.pos.x,h.pos.y)){i++;}
    expose(this){ this.h.pos = this.path[i%this.path.Count]; }
  } } }
\end{lstlisting}
In both versions, we designed \Q@Point@ and \Q@Hamster@ in a general way, and not solely to be used by classes with an invariant, in particular \Q@Point@ is not an immutable class. However, doing this in Spec\# proved difficult, in particular we were unable to override \Q@Object.Equals@, or even define a usable \Q@equals@ method that takes a \Q@Point@, as such we could not call either \Q@List<Point>.Contains@ or \Q@List<Point>.IndexOf@.
 
\noindent Even with all the above annotations, we still needed special care in creating \Q@Cage@s:
\begin{lstlisting}[
%basicstyle=\footnotesize,
language={[Sharp]C}, morekeywords={invariant,ensures,requires,expose,exists}]
List<Point> pl = new List<Point>{new Point(0,0), new Point(0,1)};
Owner.AssignSame(pl, Owner.ElementProxy(pl));
Cage c = new Cage(new Hamster(new Point(0, 0)), pl);
\end{lstlisting}
Whereas with our system we can simply write:
\begin{lstlisting}
List<Point> pl = List.of(new Point(0, 0), new Point(0, 1));
Cage c = new Cage(new Hamster(new Point(0, 0)), pl);
\end{lstlisting}

%3 read 2 capsule 3 mut extra method moveTo
%----
In Spec\# we had to add $10$ different annotations, of $8$ different kinds; some of which were quite \REV{involved}{1}{Vague and without any specific technical meaning}. In comparison, our approach requires only $7$ simple keywords, of $3$ different kinds, however \REV{we did need to create a separate \Q@moveTo@ method}{2}{So you needed to change your program to use your technique.}, since we do not want to burden our language with extra constructs such as Spec\#'s \Q@expose@.
%  Moreover we had been unable to reuse 
% \Q@Object.Equals@, \Q@List.IndexOf@ and % \Q@List.Contains@.
% Note: we had to add a new class \Q@PureObject@, since the \Q@Objec@ constructor is not annotated as \Q@[Pure]@.

%  static method capsule Box boxWithButton(capsule Widgets cs){
%    mut Box b=new Box(5,5,cs);

%class MoveAction implements Action{
%  mut Box outer; MoveAction(mut Box outer){this.outer=outer;}
%  mut method Void process(Event event) {this.outer.l+=1;} }
%\end{lstlisting}

%Ideally, we would like the invariant to be dynamically checked 
%at the end of the constructor and at the end of the \Q@move@ method.
%However, this would be unsound without some form of aliasing control over \Q@Hamster@,
%the \Q@List@ and all the \Q@Point@s, as shown in the following example\footnote{
%The visible state semantic prevent \Q@toString()@ from producing a non nonsensical result
%by checking the invariant and throwing an invariant error.
%}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%List<Point>ps=Arrays.asList(new Point(2,3),new Point(4,5));
%Cage c=new Cage(new Hamster(new Point(2,3),ps);
%//invariant holds here
%ps.get(0).x=8;//invariant is broken here, since ps
%//was accessible from outside the cage
%c.toString()//the hamster is in a position that is not on the list
%c.invariant();//return false!!
%\end{lstlisting}

%Moreover, this is unsound also if we can not ensure determinism of the invariant method;
%for example we could have an \Q@EvilList@

%\begin{lstlisting}
%class EvilList<T> extends ArrayList<T>{..
%  @Override boolean contains(T elem){return new Random().bool();}
%}
%..
%List<Point>ps=Arrays.asList(new Point(2,3),new Point(4,5));
%Cage c=new Cage(new Hamster(new Point(2,3),ps);
%//invariant happens to holds at the end of the constructor by chance,
%c.invariant();//here instead it return false!!
%\end{lstlisting}

%Despite the code for \Q@Cage.invariant()@ intuitively looking correct and deterministic, the above calls to it are not. Obviously this breaks any reasoning and should be considered unsound. 
%In particular, note how in the presence of dynamic class loading, 
%we can not make any assumption on the dynamic type of \Q@path@.

%In L42 we only need to add 
%1 \Q@read@, 2 \Q@mut@ and 1 \Q@capsule@ annotations.
%We also need to add a new method \Q@moveTo@. This is equivalent to the explicit \Q@expose(this){..}@
%block required in Spec\#.

%To keep the syntax familiar, we present our code example in a tweaked Java syntax using type modifiers.
%If a method override an interface method, we inherit the modifiers from the interface.
%Any non annotated type is implicitly immutable.
%Note how we just added 1 \Q@read@, 2 \Q@mut@ and 2 \Q@capsule@ annotations; in L42 constructors can be automatically generated, this would remove the need for 1 of the\Q@capsule@ annotations.
%We also need to add a new method \Q@moveTo@. This is equivalent to the explicit \Q@expose(this){..}@
%block required in Spec\#.

%In L42 any non annotated type is implicitly immutable.
%We also need to add a new method \Q@moveTo@. This is equivalent to the explicit \Q@expose(this){..}@
%block required in Spec\#.
%In this paper we will show how those minor code modifications are sufficient
%to statically verify that runtime verification is needed only
%after the constructor and after the \Q@moveTo@ method.
%We will also show how designing the standard library in OCs style
%ensures that any \Q@read@ method with no parameters (as \Q@invariant()@) is
%deterministic.
%We obtain our results thanks to coarse grained type system support and a careful design of the standard library, where all the possible sources of non determinism follow the OCs style.
%---------------------

%We evaluate our contribution by means of case studies;
\textit{Contents of this paper:}
We have fully implemented our protocol in L42\footnote{An experimental version of L42 supporting the protocol described in this paper, together with the full code of our case studies is available at \url{http://l42.is/ProgrammingArtifact.zip}.}\footnote{We also believe it would be easy to implement our protocol in Pony and Gordon et. al.'s language.}, we used this implementation to implement and test an interactive GUI involving a class with an invariant. On a test case with $5$ objects with an invariant, 
our protocol proved to perform only $77$ invariant checks, whereas visible state semantics performs over $53$ million checks. We also compared with Spec\#, whose invariant protocol provides the same performance as ours, however the annotation burden was almost $4$ times higher than our approach.
\REV{In this paper we argue that our protocol is not only more succinct than the pack-unpack approach, but is also easier and safer to use.}{1}{Not sufficiently substantiated}
Moreover, our approach deals with more scenarios than most prior work: \REV{we allow sound catching of invariant failures, and also carefully handle non-deterministic operations like I/O.}{1}{Not sufficiently substantiated.}
%In our case study we show that
%we can still encode most of the examples explored in ~\cite{???} (including for example mutable collections of immutable objects) whilst having a significantly lower annotation-burden.
Section \ref{s:background} explains the \emph{type modifier} and \emph{object capability} support we use for this work.
Section \ref{s:validate} examples the details of our invariant protocol.
Sections \ref{s:immState} and \ref{s:encapsulated} explains and motivates how our protocol can handle invariants over immutable and encapsulated data, respectively.
Section \ref{s:patterns} presents our GUI case study and compares it against visible state semantics and Spec\#.
Sections \ref{s:related} and \ref{s:conclusion} provide related work and conclusions.
Appendices \ref{s:meaning} and \ref{s:proof} contain, respectively, a formalisation of our protocol and proves that it is sound.
