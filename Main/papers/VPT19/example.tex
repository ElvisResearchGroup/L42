\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Quasi Quotation~\cite{moggi1999idealized,pitman1980special,sheard2002template} is a very expressive metaprogramming technique: it allows expressing arbitrary behaviour by
generating arbitrary abstract syntax trees.
However it is hard to reason about Quasi Quotation statically,
the process is fundamentally low-level, imperative and bug prone.
In this paper we present Iterative Composition as
an \textbf{effective alternative} to Quasi Quotation.
Iterative Composition describes a code composition algebra over established code reuse techniques,
similar to trait composition and generics.
Our main contribution is that by applying functional reasoning (such as induction and folds)
over those well-known operators we can generate arbitrary behaviour.
This allows us to reuse the extensive body of verification research in the 
context of object-oriented languages to verify the properties
of the code generated by Iterative Composition.
Finally, we present a prototype implementation of Iterative Composition in the context of the 42 language.
