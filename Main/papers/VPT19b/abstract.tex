\begin{abstract}
In this paper we show how the techniques used for method contracts in class-based OO languages, with conventional inheritance, can be applied to the more powerful and general mechanism of \emph{iterative trait composition}. Iterative trait composition extends the notion of \emph{trait composition} by combining it with support for meta-circular meta-programming.

We present a novel extension to the core trait composition operator that guarantees that any meta-code taking in statically verified traits, will produce a `correct' trait. We achieve this property by simply checking the compatibility of method contracts when composing traits. Importantly, our approach does \emph{not} require invoking a static verifier on the result of meta-programming, or during its execution.
