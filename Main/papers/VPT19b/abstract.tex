Here we show how we can use the metaprogramming technique of \emph{iterative composition} to generate statically correct code, given correct code as input. This technique does not require that the result of metaprogramming be run through a static verify, since we guarantee it's correctness, assuming the correctness of input.

TODO: What is iterative composition? And how does this work compare//build uppon prior work?
