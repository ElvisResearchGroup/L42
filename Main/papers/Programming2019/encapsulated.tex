\section{Validating encapsulated state}
\label{s:encapsulated}
\saveSpace
%Suppose we wanted to have a type and mutate it's state, but have such mutation's validated:


%It is very common for an object to be logically defined by the composition of sub-objects.
%The head object would then driving mutation of the sub-objects, and public methods
%of the sub-objects may be used in the validation. 
% However, the sub objects may come from a third party library, that is not annotated with contracts, and the %authors may change their behaviour in the future. Worst, they actual dynamic type may be dynamically loaded
%so that there is no way to predict their behaviour.
%That is, we are unable or unwilling to constrain sub-objects to
% cooperate into verification. We aim for verification to be correct independently of
% possibly buggy, possibly even malicious sub-objects.


Consider managing shipping items, where we keep an acceptable ship weight:
\saveSpace
%shipping list /UPS cost too much over 300
\begin{lstlisting}
class ShippingList {
  capsule Items items;
  read method Bool invariant() {
    return this.items.weight() <= 300;}
  ShippingList(capsule Items items) {
    this.items = items;
    if (!this.invariant()) {throw Error(...);}}//injected check
  mut method Void addItem(Item item) {
    this.items.add(item);
    if (!this.invariant()) {throw Error(...);}}}//injected check
\end{lstlisting}
\saveSpace
To handle this class we just inject calls to \Q@invariant@ at the end of the constructor and the \Q@addItem@ method.
This is safe since the \Q@items@ field is declared \Q@capsule@.
Relaxing our system to allows a \Q@mut@ modifier for
the \Q@items@ field and the corresponding constructor parameter 
makes the code broken:
the cargo we received in the constructor may be already compromised:
\saveSpace
\begin{lstlisting}
mut ShippingList l = new ShippingList(evilAlias);
// l is ok now, but we can break it
evilAlias.addItem(new HeavyItem()); // l is now invalid!
\end{lstlisting}
\saveSpace 
As you can see it would be possible for external code with no knowledge of the \Q@ShippingList@ to mutate its items.%
\footnote{
Conventional ownership solves these problems by requiring a deep clone of all the data the constructor takes as input, as well as all exposed data (possibly through getters).
In order to write correct library code in mainstream languages like Java/C++, defensive cloning~\cite{Bloch08} is needed.
%\REVComm{
For performance reasons, this is hardly done in practice and is a continuous source of bugs and unexpected behaviour~\cite{Bloch08}.}
%}{2}{citation to support this?}

Our restrictions on capsule mutators ensure that capsule fields are essentially an exclusive mutable reference.
Removing these restrictions would break our invariant protocol.
If we was to allow \Q@x.items@ to be seen as \Q@mut@ even if
\Q@x@ is not \Q@this@, then even if the \Q@ShippingList@ has full control at initialization time,
such control may be lost later:
\saveSpace
\begin{lstlisting}
mut ShippingList l = new ShippingList(new Items());
// l is ok now
mut Items evilAlias = l.items // here l loses control
// l is still ok
evilAlias.addItem(new HeavyItem()); // we invalidated l now
\end{lstlisting}
\saveSpace
If we allow for a \Q@mut@ return type this would be accepted:
\saveSpace
\begin{lstlisting}
mut method mut Items expose(C c) {return c.foo(this.items);}
\end{lstlisting}
\saveSpace
\noindent Depending on dynamic dispatch on \Q@c@, \Q@c.foo()@ may just be the identity function, thus
we would get in the same situation of the former example.
%Static analysis is usually unable/unwilling to track precise behaviour of dynamic dispatch.


%In addition to the above we put restrictions on any \Q@mut@ and \Q@capsule@ methods using a \Q@capsule@ field (we call such methods `capsule mutators'):
%\begin{itemize}
%\item only a single use of \Q@this@ is allowed (and is the one that uses the field),
%\item no \Q@mut@ or \Q@read@ parameters are allowed (apart from the implicit \Q@this@ parameter)
%\item and the return type cannot be \Q@mut@.
%\end{itemize}
%\noindent  Moreover, if the used capsule field is referenced in \validate, a \Q@this.validate()@ call is injected at the end of the method.


Allowing \Q@this@ to be used more then once can also cause problems:
\saveSpace
\begin{lstlisting}
mut method imm Void multiThis(C c) {
  read Foo f = c.foo(this);
  this.items.add(new HeavyItem());
  f.hi();} // Can `this' be observed here?
\end{lstlisting}
\saveSpace
\noindent If the former code was accepted, depending on dynamic dispatch on \Q@c@,
\Q@this@ may be reachable from \Q@f@, thus \Q@f.hi()@ may observe an invalid object.

In order to ensure that a second reference to \Q@this@ is not reachable through the parameters we only accept \Q@imm@ and \Q@capsule@ parameters.
If we were however to accept a \Q@read@ parameter, as in the example below,
we would be in the same situation as the former example, where \Q@f@ may contain
a reference to \Q@this@:
\saveSpace
\begin{lstlisting}
mut method imm Void addHeavy(read Foo f) {
  this.items.add(new HeavyItem())
  f.hi()} // Can `this' be observed here?
...
mut ShippingList l = new ShippingList();
read Foo f = new Foo(l);
l.addHeavy(f); // We pass another reference to `l' through f
\end{lstlisting}
\saveSpace

%, we would have the same problem with a \Q@read@ paramater. ... justify why we ned capsule
% The boat will sink if the weight of the cargo goes over 300. However, 
% \Q@Item@ and \Q@Items@ come from a third party library,  are not annotated with contracts and the authors may change their behaviour in the future. 
% All the code using \Q@Boat@  (client code) would like to  assume the boat has not sunk yet.
% In turn, that depends on the behaviour of \Q@Items.weight()@, thus the meaning of the \Q@Boat@ invariant is parametric on the everchanging meaning of  \Q@Items.weight()@.
% Can the code in the \Q@Boat@ class somehow enforce that for every possible well typed \Q@Item@ and \Q@Items@, client code will interact only with valid (non sunk)  boats?
% That is, we are unable or unwilling to constrain \Q@Item@ and \Q@Items@ to
% cooperate into making \Q@Boat@s unsinkable; 
% we aim to make so that \Q@Boat@s can be correct independently of
% possibly buggy, possibly even malicious \Q@Item@ and \Q@Items@ implementations.
% Indeed, thanks to the encapsulation, any kind of check in the language,
% as in `\Q@if(cargo.weight()>=300){..}@', would delegate the 
% behaviour to untrusted code in \Q@Items@.

% \textbf{without any knowledge about the behaviour of \Q@add()@ and \Q@weight()@}
% \footnote{A statically verified system with contracts on all methods may have this kind of knowledge.}
% there is no way we can discover the invariant violation without actually adding the objects and checking the 
% weight after the fact; thus in the general case violations can only be detected 
% when a broken object is already present in the system.
% Remember that to keep our approach lightweight,
% we do not rely on pre-post conditions; thus
% the behaviour of \Q@Items.weight()@ and \Q@Items.add(item)@ is uncertain.
% The names may suggest a specific behaviour, but there is no contract annotated on such methods.

% Note also that in the general case there is no way to fix a broken object,
%or to perform a deep clone and to test the operation on the clone first.


%REWRITE THIS BIT
%Here capsule fields 
%as input to our code-generation / \Q@validate()@-injection; that is, \Q@capsule T f@ is expanded by the language into:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Induce a \Q@capsule@ parameter for the generated %constructor.
%\item Require to be updated with a \Q@capsule@ expression.
%\item Are accessed as a \Q@mut@ field.
%Access is \textbf{not} a destructive read.
% However methods accessing them are kept under
%strict control; either
%\begin{itemize}
%\item they have \Q@read this@: they act like a normal %getter, and can not propagate
%writing permission over the ROG of that field.
%Indeed, with \Q@read this@, any field access \Q@this.f@ will be typed \Q@read@ or \Q@imm@.
%\item they have \Q@mut this@, no parameter is \Q@mut@ or \Q@read@,
%the return type is not \Q@mut@ and \Q@this@ appear exactly one time in
%the method body: we call those methods \textbf{exposers}, and the invariant is going to be checked at the end of
%the exposers.
%\end{itemize}


%\end{itemize}
%Exposers are the key part of our solution.


% Those restrictions also enforce that while executing a capsule-mutator no object outside the ROG of \Q@this@ can be mutated, and thus capability objects cannot be usedI/O can not be performed: the capability objects are externally visible mutable objects and thus the type system will never place them into a \Q@capsule@.
%\subsection{The true expressibility of capsule modifiers}
%A capsule mutator method is a wrapper of a logical operation on a field, which is guaranteed to not see the \Q@this@ object.
%Thus, if \Q@this@ where to become broken during 
%the method's execution, we could not observe it until after. At first glance, it may seems that capsule %mutators allows for limited kinds of mutations.
%This is however not the case, consider the following
%general capsule mutator method that allows to apply any possible transformation over the content of a capsule %field:

\section{Patterns for flexible verification}
\label{s:patterns}
\saveSpace
Here we discuss how to use conventional OO programming patterns to take advantage of our system. Using those
patterns allows to circumvent some of the apparent limitations of our system.
\noindent\textit{The transform pattern:}
A capsule mutator method is a wrapper over a logical operation on a field, which is guaranteed to not see the \Q@this@ object.
Thus, if \Q@this@ is made invalid during 
the method's execution, we could not observe it until after the method completes.
At first glance, it may seem that capsule mutators allow only very limited kinds of mutation.
This is however not the case. 

Consider the following
simple pattern to allow flexible use of capsule fields: define a \Q@transform@ function and a \Q@ItemTransformer@ interface like so:


%interface Foo{ma mb}
%
%class Raw implements Foo{
%  no validate 
%}
%class ValidFoo1 implemens Foo{
%  private capsule Foo inner;
%  ma(){
%    this.inner.ma();
%  }
%  validate
%}
%
%
%class Raw {
%  mut method mut A stuff(read A a) {
%      if a.bar() {
%         x = ...
%      }
%      return new A(x)
%  }
%
%  read method imm Object stuffPre(read A a) {
%     return a.bar()
%  }
%  read method mut A stuffPost(imm Object o) {
%     return new A(x)
%  }
%  mut method imm Object stuffInner(imm Object) {
%      x = ...
%  }
%}
%class ValidFoo1 {
%	cpasule Raw r;
%  mut method mut A stuff(read A a) {
%     imm Object p = this.r.stuffPre(a);
%     imm Object res = this.transformR(r -> r.stuffInner(p));
%      return this.r.stuffPost(res)
%  }
%}
%
%
%
%class ValidFoo2 implemens Foo{
%  private capsule Foo inner;
%  validate
%}

\saveSpace
\begin{lstlisting}
interface Transformer<T> {method Void apply(mut T items);}
class ShippingList {...
  mut method Void transformItems(Transformer<Items> t) {
   t.apply(this.items);
   if (!this.validate()) {throw Error(...);}}}//injected check
\end{lstlisting}
The \Q@.transformItems()@ method 
offers an expressive power similar to a
\Q@mut@ getter, but ensures that 
the field content cannot leak out.
For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=\%]
// Lambda Expression that creates a new Transformer<Items>
this.transformItems(items -> items.add(new Item(..)))
\end{lstlisting}
%//`i' is captured by the closure.
%// `imm' and `capsule' varaibles can be captured.

%    %\Comment{}%this.items.add(i);
%    // Cant instead capture `this': it can't be typed %as `imm'
%    // since `ItemTransformer.transform()' is an %`imm' method
%  })
%}
%  // instead of:
  %\Comment{}%this.exposeItems().add(i)

Note that the code above does not access a capsule field but merely calls a method that does; thus
it is \emph{not} a capsule mutator method, so it is not constrained by the restrictions on them. Code like the above would also allow one to mutate multiple capsule fields in one method.
Our pattern cooperates with the language’s restrictions to ensure each mutation is completed as a separate operation, that is perceived by the rest of the system
as if it was atomic.%
%,  i.e. they can't see or update the other capsule fields.


\loseSpace
\noindent\textit{The box pattern:}
At first glance it would seem that by only being able to validate immutable and encapsulated state one could not create validated classes with complicated, mutable interconnected object graphs, such as a doubly linked list:
\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=\%]
class List {
  mut List prev;
  mut List next;
  Object elem;  
  read method Bool ok() {
    return this.next.prev==this && this.prev.next==this &&..;}
  read method Int size(){
    if(next==this){return 1;} return next.size()+1;}}
\end{lstlisting}
Clearly the \Q@mut@ fields of \Q@List@ cannot be marked as \Q@capsule@.
However, only \Q@capsule@ and \Q@imm@
fields can be accessed in \validate.
Thus, \Q@.innerValidate()@ can not be the \validate{} method for \Q@List@.
The solution is to use a `box' over our \Q@List@, and to validate our `box':

\loseSpace\loseSpace\loseSpace
\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=\%]
class ListBox { 
  capsule List inner;
  read method imm Bool invariant() {return this.inner.ok();}
  read method Int size(){ return this.inner.size();}
\end{lstlisting}
\saveSpace
Encoding this example in Spec\# would be much more verbose (see case study XX) and still require
a \Q@ListBox@ object,
while the visible state semantic of Eiffel or D would cause an large amount of \Q@invariant@ checks
if the list had any recursive method; consider for example the \Q@size@ method:
if there was an invariant with visible state semantic on \Q@List@, calling \Q@List.size()@ would require 
calling \Q@List.invariant()@ before and after the method execution. If the list has more then one element, the recursive \Q@size@ call would also call the invariant twice.
We would also want to create forwarding methods in \Q@ListBox@ for all public methods defined in \Q@List@. This approach allows the validation of many interesting and practically useful data-structures.
However the limitations of capsule mutator methods mean that any \Q@mut@ methods in \Q@ListBox@ taking \Q@read@ or \Q@mut@ parameters, or returning \Q@mut@, cannot be trivially forwarded.
% since they necessitate mutating a \Q@capsule@, instead complicated and involved forwarding would be needed, if it is even possible.
Our example is about a list of immutable objects.
To instead validate a list of \Q@mut@ objects we would need to use our box pattern not just around the list,
but around a section of data encapsulating both the list and all the contained elements.
This is because our simple \Q@capsule@ modifier requires the whole ROG to be encapsulated.
Conceptually, it would be better for the list (of mutable objects) to be validated by its
head, since the behaviour of the contained objects is transparent to the validation criteria. 
Our limitation relates to full encapsulation and contrasts with flexible encapsulation as in 
ownership~\cite{ClarkeEtAl98}. However, neither traditional flexible encapsulation/ownership, nor our language are capable of verifying that \Q@List.elem@ is not (indirectly) referenced within \Q@ListBox.validate()@.
