\noindent\textit{Context:} % What is the broad context of the work? What is the importance of the general research area?
Object-oriented programming languages through sub-typing and dynamic dispatch provide great flexibility: they allow code to be adapted/specialised to behave differently in different contexts.
However this flexibility hampers code reasoning, which is made even more complex by dynamic class loading (supported by many mainstream OO languages).
Thus object behaviour is nearly completely unrestricted. This is further complicated with the support OO languages typically have for exceptions, imperative code, and I/O.
In the absence of on the fly static verification of dynamically loaded code, it is difficult for programmers to write code that is correct in a library setting.

\loseSpace
\noindent\textit{Inquiry:} %What problem or question does the paper address? How has this problem or question been addressed by others (if at all)?
We wish to guarantee that for all observable objects, their class-invariant holds.
%We wish to guarantee that a class's invariant holds for all its observable instances.
We wish to ensure simpler and stronger reasoning over the usual convention that class invariants 
need only hold on boundaries of public instance methods.

Most prior work on enforcing class invariants assume unverified/unverifiable restrictions on library code, 
dynamic class loading and I/O, or even just trust programmers to use the provided tools correctly.
For example, static verification often restricts dynamic class loading, while 
run-time verification often unsoundly allows non deterministic code in class-invariants.

%We wish to allow for stronger reasoning over this by ensuring that non boke
%We wish to guarantee that a user defined property holds for all observable instances of a class.
%This is a variation of class invariants, where objects in a broken state can never be observed.

\loseSpace
\noindent\textit{Approach:} %What was done that unveiled new knowledge?
We combine previous work on type modifiers and object capabilities to ensure function-purity, aliasing 
and mutability control. Type modifiers and object capabilities are useful in their own right, 
but we use these facilities here to enforce class-invariants by injecting runtime-validation code. 
Our approach is sound since we ensure that class-invariants are pure and can only be violated in 
controlled situations.

\loseSpace
\noindent\textit{Knowledge:} %What new facts were uncovered? If the research was not results oriented, what new capabilities are enabled by the work?
By means of examples, we show how hard it is to reason about code behaviour in
the context of dynamic class loading and I/O.
Building over type modifiers and object capabilities, we lay down the foundation needed to
reason about OO code in this context. Without such reasoning
enforcing class-invariants for all objects involved in execution becomes nearly impossible.
We show, that in comparison to other approaches, type-modifiers and object capabilities allow for such reasoning to be both simpler and sound in a broader scope.

\loseSpace
\noindent\textit{Grounding:} %What argument, feasibility proof, artifacts, or results and evaluation support this work?
We demonstrate, by means of a case study, empirical evidence of the performance and compactness of our approach in comparison to Spec\# and the conventional runtime-verification methodology.

We formally model a class of languages that soundly enforce class-invariants. This model is formally verified by a proof, parametric on the presence of a type system which guarantees certain properties of type modifiers. Type systems with such properties have already been explored, formalized, and proved in prior work.

\loseSpace
\noindent\textit{Importance:} %Why does this work matter?
Class-invariants allow programmers to reason about what states objects can be in. Our approach
makes such reasoning both sound and strong: if a programmer has access to an object, it and 
all objects reachable from it are in a valid state.
This is of great practical importance since it is independent of the presence of buggy code, or even dynamically loaded malicious code.


%TODO
% \REVComm{Our work represents a philosophical shift}{2}{This makes it sound like run-time verification has never been considered before.} similar to the jump from unchecked casts in C to checked casts in Java: it is the programmer's responsibility to create valid objects and to preserve validation
% while mutating objects, however a validation failure is soundly detected by a run-time exception,
% and even after capturing such an exception, validation still holds for all objects involved in the execution.
%Class invariants provide guarantees about the state of objects throughout the execution.
%Runtime verification of class invariants is
%a hard problem due to issues with aliasing, exceptions,
%non-deterministic invariants, I/O, subtyping and untrusted code.
%We challenge this problem in the context of
%a Java-like language where the invariants are expressed in the language itself.
%We formally define \textbf{Sound Invariant Checking}
%and formally prove that a combination of carefully selected type modifiers, object capabilities,
% and strong exception safety is sufficient
%to handle Sound Invariant Checking for the most common categories of objects.
