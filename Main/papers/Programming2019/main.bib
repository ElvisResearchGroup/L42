Since then, a number of tools providing support for software contracts have been developed. In this paper, we explore eleven such technologies to investigate their approach to various aspects of software contracts. We present the similarities as well as the areas of significant disagreement and highlight the shortcomings of existing technologies. We briefly introduce PACT, a software contract tool under development, explaining its approach to various aspects of software contracts.",
