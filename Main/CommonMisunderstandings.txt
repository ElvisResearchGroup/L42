Here we should collect common misunderstanding that can
arise about 42 semantic
1----
in a block, a value thrown in a catch, leaks out of the whole block.
NOT in the next catch/paragraph-catch
2------
var Foo x is
a label called x that can be attached to many different
immutable Foo.

mut Foo x is
a permanent super glued label, initialized on a mutable Foo.

3------
metaprogramming is "functional" in the sense that new code is created
but there is no way to modify old code.
